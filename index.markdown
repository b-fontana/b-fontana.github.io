**Talk @ PyHEP21**: *We discuss and justify the application of Python's Bokeh library to non-interactive and interactive visualization. A comparison between Bokeh and some widely used alternatives is made. We include a tutorial covering the key aspects necessary to create virtually any interactive plot needed in HEP, and provide custom examples and code.*
